<h1> PDM-AndroidApp-Proj </h1>
<p align="justify"> <b><i>DISCLAIMER:</i></b> This project was solely developed by myself for the class of Programming of Mobile Devices. I haven't translated any of the Java code, as it was a lot. There are multiple things throughout the whole project that need optimization, as well as others that need minor corrections. </p>

<p align="justify"> With the code I provide, you won't be able to single-handedly replicate the project, but it is a great help for similar projects. </p>
